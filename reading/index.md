# Non-fiction

**Stefan Zweig, <cite data-key="Zweig1942">Die Welt von Gestern</cite>.**
Currently reading this in German. I live in Vienna and it's been very
interesting to compare Zweig's description of the "world of security",
the Vienna in the decades before the first World War at the end of the
Habsburg monarchy, with the Vienna of today. Most amusing is Zweig's
description of how the young struggle to be taken seriously: young
doctors must grow long beards to get patients, and even a 40-year old
man might be looked down on as "too inexperienced".

**David Graeber, <cite data-key="Graeber2011">Debt: the first 5000 years</cite>.**
This one's been on my list for years, but I finally got around to it in early
2024, after reading several other things from Graeber in the last
couple of years. It's a tour de force, well worth reading and
discussing. At some point I might write a longer review; until then,
others are not hard to find.

**George Orwell, <cite data-key="Orwell1938">Homage to Catalonia</cite>.**
Another classic that had been on my list for a while; I read it on
vacation in Sweden in 2023. I hear (from Spaniards, though I'm not
sure they've read it) that Orwell's account is not to be trusted for
historical accuracy, despite his pleading in the book that he is
telling the real story (or at least, *a* real story) that won't
otherwise be found in the approved sources of history, especially the
newspapers of the day. I downloaded the text from
[george-orwell.org](http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/)
and made an EPUB out of it, correcting typos as I went.
<!-- **HERE** is the result; feel free to send me further corrections. -->

**David Graeber, <cite data-key="Graeber2018">Bullshit Jobs</cite>.**
Not a particularly encouraging book to read if you're already feeling
burned out in the modern industrial economy, and not, I would say,
Graeber's best work, but it gives a name to an important phenomenon
that we all knew was there: white-collar "work" that isn't doing
anything productive, that actually harms those doing it, and that
mostly exists because other people feel better when they're at the top
of a hierarchy.

**David Graeber and David Wendgrow,
<cite data-key="GraeberWendgrow2022">The Dawn of Everything</cite>.**

# Fiction

**[Terry Pratchett](http://www.gnuterrypratchett.com/)'s
  <cite data-key="PratchettDW">Discworld</cite> series.**
I've been working through it since December 2023. I did not expect to
enjoy anything featuring wizards and magic and dwarves and trolls and
goblins; but after much prodding by a friend, I started with *Thud!*
and haven't been able to stop. Pratchett is a devastating satirist and
a sharp, if sometimes cyncial, observer of human character. (*Thud!*
is, incidentally, not a good starting point if you're considering
jumping into the series yourself; it was a random choice on my part,
but at least had the virtue of featuring Sam Vimes in his prime. If
I'd started with the chronologically-first *The Color of Magic* I'm
not sure I would have continued.) I've mostly followed
[this visual guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld#/media/File:Discworld_Reading_Order_Guide_3.0_(cropped).jpg),
reading two or three storylines in parallel.
I've enjoyed the City Watch, Death, and Industrial Revolution
storylines the most; I'd recommend the Watch storyline if you're
looking for a starting point.

<!-- Stanisław Lem, <cite>One hundred and thirty seven seconds</cite>.  -->

**Gabriele Zevin, <cite data-key="Zevin2022">Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow</cite>**,
a novel about friendship set against the backdrop of 90s computer games.
Thus it fell close to my heart. I read it in 2023 in German
(<cite lang=de">Morgen und morgen und wieder morgen</cite>), despite it
being originally in English, and it still managed to move me to tears at
some points.

**China Miéville, <cite lang="de">Die Stadt und die Stadt</cite>**
(orig. <cite data-key="Mieville2009">The City and the City</cite>).
A fascinating noir novel that looks at what it would mean for two
states to have overlapping territory, an idea that seemed better to me
before I read this.

**Xi Xi, <cite data-key="Xi1979" lang="de">Meine Stadt</cite>**.
This turned out to be less of a novel than a novel-length poem,
translated from the original Chinese into German. Though there are
recurring characters, the connections between the chapters are not
always apparent, and it was hard for to me follow along, especially in
German. I didn't manage to finish it, though apparently the final
chapter explains some of the looser threads.

**Neil Stephenson, <cite data-key="Stephenson1992">Snow Crash</cite>.**
Went back to fill in this gap in my Stephenson shelf after finishing
*Anathem*. It was everything I'd heard: zany, hilarious, exciting, and
a perfect recording of the techno-dystopian vision at the center of
90s culture in America (which in some ways has come to pass). If you
liked *The Matrix* or anything else from the period, you'll love it.

**Neil Stephenson, <cite data-key="Stephenson2008">Anathem</cite>.**
This novel apparently splits Stephenson's readership into lovers and
haters; I fell into the lovers camp. What appealed to me most of all
was the picture of monastic life inside the Concent, the combination
of learning and research with agriculture and communal existence and
the isolation from the technological and economic ravages outside the
walls. It's a vision of an alternative lifestyle that I would welcome
in this world.
