# Me {#author tocd="about rwl"}

I am rwl, philosopher, programmer, and cobbler of text.

<address id="contact" data-tocd="email, etc.">
Richard W. Lawrence\
rwl + [the usual commercial accounting
symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign) + recursewithless.net
</address>

## Others {#others data-tocd="people who I am not"}

Despite my name, please don't confuse me with:

- [Richard Lawrence, failed assassin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lawrence_(failed_assassin))
- [Richard Lawrence, fallen Vietnam soldier](http://1-22infantry.org/kia/lawrencepers.htm)
- [Richard Lawrence, "Britain's leading authority on the paranormal and psychic
  healer"](http://jerrypippin.com/Paranormal_Richard_Lawrence.htm)
  (though please do peruse [this review of his book *UFOs and the
  Extraterrestrial Message*](https://www.darkstar1.co.uk/ufosmessage.htm))
- or even [Richard Lawrence, Vermont representative](https://legislature.vermont.gov/people/single/2018.1/14570), although he was from my home state
  
or with any of [these notable people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lawrence). The 'w' is important.
  

# The domain {#domain data-tocd="about 'recursewithless.net'"}

The domain name "recursewithless.net" is a play on some of my interests in:

-   mathematics and logic
-   languages and language
-   computing and programming

It is also:

-   a metaphor for postdoctoral existence
-   a backronym for my initials.

# rwlsh {#shell data-tocd="about rwlsh"}

If your screen is large enough and you have JavaScript enabled, you'll
see [rwlsh]{.kbd}, a shell-like command loop for browsing the page. 

<noscript>
(However, if you can read *this* paragraph, then you don't have
JavaScript enabled, and rwlsh won't appear. The site should work fine
without it, so please let me know if it doesn't.)
</noscript>

If you've ever used a Unix or DOS shell, or a text-based adventure
game, this should feel familiar.

If you haven't, try the [toc]{.kbd} command to see the table of
contents. To see more commands, use the [help]{.kbd} command. To run a
command, press [Enter]{.kbd}.

rwlsh is an experiment based on a few ideas:

-   hierarchical namespace: a document is a tree of named nodes, like a
    filesystem
-   local position: you are always "at" some node in the tree, and can
    focus on the local scenery there
-   command language: you change position and take other actions by
    issuing commands to the shell

rwlsh is just some JavaScript hand-written by me. Feel free to
[browse the source](/lib/js/tui.js), or
send me a note with the [mail]{.kbd} command to suggest improvements!
