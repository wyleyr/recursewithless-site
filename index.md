## The name {#name data-tocd="about the name"}

The name "recursewithless.net" is a play on some of my interests in:

-   mathematics and logic
-   languages and language
-   computing and programming

It is also:

-   a metaphor for postdoctoral existence
-   a backronym for my initials.

## The interface {#interface data-tocd="about this interface"}

If your screen is large enough and you have JavaScript enabled, you'll
see rwlsh, a shell-like interface for browsing the page. 

If you've ever used a Unix or DOS shell, or a text-based adventure
game, this should feel familiar.

If you haven't, try the [toc]{.kbd} command to see the table of
contents. To see more commands, use the [help]{.kbd} command. To run a
command, press [Enter]{.kbd}.

rwlsh is an experiment based on a few ideas:

-   hierarchical namespace: a document is a tree of named nodes, like a
    filesystem
-   local position: you are always "at" some node in the tree, and can
    focus on the local scenery there
-   command language: you change position and take other actions by
    issuing commands to the shell

Send me a note with the [mail]{.kbd} command to suggest improvements!

<noscript>
If you can read *this* paragraph, then you don't have
JavaScript enabled, and rwlsh won't appear. The site should work fine
without it, so please let me know if it doesn't.
