I am rwl, philosopher, programmer, and cobbler of text.
recursewithless.net is a site by and about me.

The name is a play on some of my interests in: 
  mathematics and logic
  languages and language
  computing and programming  

It is also:
  a metaphor for postdoctoral existence
  a backronym for my initials.

Thanks for stopping by!

In a web browser with JavaScript enabled, you'll see
a shell-like interface for browsing the site.
I like text based interfaces.
I'm experimenting with this one.
Send me a note if you see a way to improve it!

If you prefer a different interface, the site should work fine without it.
Just disable JavaScript, or use a text-based browser like lynx.
