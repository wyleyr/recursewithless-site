Over Easter Break 2023, I went on a bicycle tour with my friend Serge.
He brought my bike over from the US in exchange for my company
(perhaps a dubious bargain on his part). We met in Lisbon and biked
down the Portuguese coast, then took a train over to Spain and spent a
few more days together in Huelva and Sevilla. We parted, alas, in
Sevilla: while Serge went on to further adventures, I flew back to
Responsibilities.
